# Node Class

A basic Node. It has the given properties:

```js
const node = new Node(value);
```

#### node.value

- Holds the value. Can be of any type
- Instantiated as the argument passed into constructor

#### node.next

- Pointer to the next node, specifically for Singly Linked Lists, Stacks, and
  Queues
- Instantiated as null

#### node.RightChild

- Pointer to the RightChild, specifically for Binary Trees
- Instantiated as null

#### node.LeftChild

- Pointer to the LeftChild, specifically for Binary Trees
- Instantiated as null

#### node.previous

- Pointer to the previous node, specifically for Doubly Linked Lists
- Instantiated as null

### Improvements for the future

- Make all properties private
- create getters for each property
- create setters for each property

class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
    this.RightChild = null;
    this.LeftChild = null;
    this.previous = null;
  }
